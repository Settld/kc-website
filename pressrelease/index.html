    <h1>Calls for new industry-wide Bereavement Standard</h1>
    <h2>
      End-of-life online account closure service offers pain relief to
      grieving families
    </h2>
    <p class="date">June 23, 2020</p>
    <b>PRESS RELEASE</b>
    <p>
      Ministers are being urged to introduce a new UK-wide Bereavement
      Standard to speed up the often protracted and painful process of closing
      personal and household accounts when someone dies.
    </p>
    <p>
      The calls come as Settld, a new online account closure service to help
      those dealing with the death of a loved one, has been awarded a UK
      Government COVID-19 grant. The automated service is due to launch at the
      end of next month.
    </p>
    <p>
      As families continue to be affected by the mounting death toll from
      coronavirus, many face the added trauma of having to make repeated calls
      to numerous utility, mobile, broadband, TV subscription, and other
      household service providers, to close the accounts of those who’ve died.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Vicky Wilson, Founder of Settld,</b> said: “Many families, who are
      already grieving for lost loved ones, are being put through additional
      unnecessary suffering because there is currently no single, centralised
      service to close accounts of all types. This means that bereaved
      relatives are forced to ring up multiple companies, sometimes several
      times, to state that their husband or wife, son, daughter, or
      grandparent, has died. It’s a process which can take weeks to resolve.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Settld wants people to be able to grieve for their loved ones rather
      than deal with stressful bereavement bureaucracy. We will help lighten
      the load for families grappling with grief by dealing with some of the
      red tape, via this free automated account closure service.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Campaigners, including Settld, are calling on the government to set an
      agreed Standard for bereavement case account closure, which service
      providers would have to meet. A petition calling on ministers to take
      swift action has been launched on
      <a href="https://www.change.org/BereavementStandard" target="_blank">Change.org</a>
      and has the backing of the national charity Cruse Bereavement Care.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Steven Wibberly, CEO of Cruse Bereavement Care</b> added: “In the
      aftermath of a close relative’s death, people should be able to spend
      time with their families grieving, rather than spending hours doing
      admin.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Last year, we launched our ‘Bereaved Customers First’ campaign which
      aims to reduce the emotional burden bereaved people face when contacting
      businesses regarding the death of someone. It is vital companies are
      compassionate and simplify their processes to ensure they are fit for
      purpose and are not causing their bereaved customers further distress,
      at an already very difficult time.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Unfortunately the coronavirus pandemic has left thousands more people
      bereaved. Anything that can be done to simplify this process for
      bereaved people will have a huge impact.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Across the UK, more than 600,000 people die every year. Currently, there
      is no approved process for closing accounts when someone dies – some
      companies demand a death certificate before closing an account, others
      seek different proof and paperwork. It can take up to a month, with
      repeated calls, to close just one account. Without a Bereavement
      Standard, unnecessary delays by providers will continue.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Former BBC TV Watchdog presenter, John Stapleton</b>, is also backing
      Settld’s call for a Bereavement Standard. He said: “As I discovered when
      my wife Lynn Faulds Wood died recently, having to deal with
      organisations such as utilities can be extremely harrowing, at a time
      when your emotions are already at a very low ebb. I would therefore
      welcome any initiative that eases what I consider to be an often
      unnecessary and time consuming burden.”
    </p>
    <p>
      While the “Tell us Once” service allows people to close government
      related accounts, and the Death Notification Service informs most banks,
      there is no service which deals with all other accounts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Online startup, Settld has received a Covid Relief grant from Innovate
      UK - the UK’s innovation agency - to help provide this much needed
      service which contacts multiple companies, in one go, via a simple web
      application.
    </p>
    <p>
      Settld will also assist local authorities, who close accounts on behalf
      of vulnerable adults or those without next of kin, and law firms who
      often have to go through the same lengthy processes for probate clients.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of last year when Vicky's grandmother died, Vicky and her mum
      Julie had to go through the stress that many COVID-19 victims’ families
      are facing at the moment. That experience led to the launch of this
      week's campaign.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vicky said: "Settld will bring an end to some of that unhelpful
      bureaucratic pain. We hope to offer at least some pain relief to those
      who are dealing with loss and ensure that end of life affairs can be
      settled quickly.”
    </p>
    <p>
      She added:“We have been selected from over 8,600 applicants for this UK
      Innovate government grant. Now, we urge ministers to heed our calls to
      introduce a Bereavement Standard which all service providers can get
      behind on behalf of their customers.”
