    <h1>Prime Minister urged to listen after end of life petition hits target</h1>
    <h2> Over 17,500 supporters demand new Bereavement Standard
    </h2>
    <p class="date">July 31, 2020</p>
    <b>PRESS RELEASE</b>
    <p>
      The Prime Minister has been urged to listen to thousands of families across the UK who are demanding better
      treatment for the newly bereaved.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the past week, more than 17,500 people have signed a petition on
      <a href="http://change.org/bereavementstandard" target="_blank">Change.org</a> calling for a new Bereavement
      Standard to reduce stress and upset for grieving families who have to spend weeks closing the accounts of loved
      ones who have died.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mother and daughter, Julie and Vicky Wilson launched the petition following the death of an elderly relative. It
      took the pair more than six weeks to close the accounts of Vicky’s gran, June, after multiple calls and emails to
      service providers.
    </p>
    <p>
      By earlier today (Friday), the petition had notched up more than 17,500 supporters calling on the government to
      set an agreed Standard for bereavement case account closures, which service providers would have to meet. The
      petition has the backing of leading bereavement charity, Cruse Bereavement Care.
    </p>
    <p>
      Julie and Vicky have since founded an online account closure service, called <a href="/">Settld</a>. The free
      service to the public will automate end of life admin, speeding up the often protracted and painful process faced
      by those closing personal and household accounts of someone who has died. Individuals who sign up will be able to
      inform multiple companies of a death in one go.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Julie Wilson, co-founder of Settld and a registered Funeral Celebrant</b>, said: "It's clear, from
      the rising numbers of people signing our petition, that bereaved families across the UK have had enough of being
      poorly treated when they have just lost loved ones. It's time for action, and it's time that the Prime Minister
      and the Minister for Bereavement listened to the voices of the bereaved. We need a Bereavement Standard to lighten
      the end of life admin load for those who are grappling with grief."
    </p>
    <p>
      Across the UK, more than 600,000 people die every year. Currently, there is no approved process for closing
      accounts when someone dies – some companies demand a death certificate before closing an account, others seek
      different proof and paperwork. It can take more than a month, with repeated calls, to close just one account. Most
      individuals have up to 20 utility, mobile, broadband, TV subscription, and other household service accounts which
      need to be closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Co-founder, Vicky Wilson</b>, added: "We have held extremely positive talks recently with service
      providers, charities, even regulators and there is certainly a consensus from these organisations to bring an end
      to unnecessary red tape and to make things easier for those who are dealing with end of life admin for their loved
      ones. With the political will we can ensure that the coronavirus pandemic has at least brought about a change for
      the better for families dealing with grief."
    </p>
    <p><b>Sarah Gigg, Director of Nursing at Sue Ryder, which supports a new Bereavement Standard</b>,
      said: "We can and must do better at supporting those coping with bereavement. The long process of notifying
      businesses and closing accounts after someone has died is a significant emotional burden for people at what can be
      the most difficult time of their lives."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When grieving, worrying about admin and navigating complex bureaucratic processes can be unbearable. It is also
      unnecessary - if companies simplified their processes, it would save those bereaved from hours of phone calls and
      sorting of paperwork.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In light of the coronavirus pandemic, which has led to an increase in the number of people grieving, it is
      vital we provide extra practical support. We urge companies to exercise compassion by adopting the Bereavement
      Standard."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bereavement Standard would set a time limit for account closures, standardise paperwork and documents
      required, and ensure service providers had dedicated bereavement channels available to customers.
