    <h1>Financial Services chiefs commit to improving services for bereaved</h1>
    <h2>
      Bank and insurance leaders consider case for digital death certificates, as YouGov poll is published
    </h2>
    <p class="date">Oct 08, 2020</p>
    <b>PRESS RELEASE - for immediate publication</b>
    <p>
      Senior executives from some of the UK’s biggest banks, building societies and insurance companies have come
      together for the first time to discuss how they can improve services for bereaved customers.
    </p>
    <p>
      More than 60 organisations, including Lloyds, Santander, Barclays, Nationwide and Legal and General, along with
      intermediary firms and brokers, attended a virtual summit hosted by end of life administration startup,
      <b>Settld.care</b> and <b>Cruse Bereavement Care</b> along with <b>Chris Pond, Chair of the Financial Inclusion
        Commission</b>, and <b>Johnny Timpson, financial protection specialist at Scottish Widows.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      A <a href="https://settld.care/pressrelease/2020_10_07_02.html" target="_blank"></a>YouGov poll released today
      (Wednesday) shows that 80% of the British public agree with all three elements of the
      proposed Bereavement Standard to improve treatment of grieving customers.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Chris Pond</b>, who co-chaired part of the summit, said: “By showing up today, the leaders of these financial
      institutions have shown their commitment to improving standards towards bereaved and vulnerable customers. They
      recognise that there are problems and they have committed to action to make things better.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Financial organisations are under pressure from various quarters - including regulators and the Financial Conduct
      Authority - to improve their treatment of vulnerable customers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The meeting comes as calls grow for streamlined end-of-life processes across all commercial sectors, partly due to
      the rising number of deaths in Britain this year caused by COVID-19.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Johnny Timpson</b> also co-chaired today’s meeting. He said: “The insurance sector understands that end of life
      admin processes can make life difficult for bereaved customers.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Timpson, also chair of the Access to Insurance Working Group, added: “Whilst nothing can take away the pain of
      losing a loved one, the insurance industry and profession is absolutely committed to helping and supporting the
      families of our bereaved customers at this most difficult of times. After today, we are keen to look at the idea
      of digital verification or digital death certificates and a central register.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The Association of British Insurers Covid-19 Pledges together with the Protection Distributors Group Funeral
      Pledge and Claims Charter are examples of just some of the steps that we have taken to make the period following
      loss of a family member just a little bit easier and we welcome the opportunity to share best practice and take
      learning from other sectors.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Nearly 90,000 people have signed an <a href="http://change.org/bereavementstandard" target="_blank">online
        petition</a> calling on the government to introduce a Bereavement Standard,
      and 50 cross-party MPs have signed a similar <a
        href="https://edm.parliament.uk/early-day-motion/57341/supporting-grieving-families-through-a-bereavement-standard"
        target="_blank">Early Day Motion</a> in the Commons. The campaign is also being featured
      on <b>BBC1’s Rip Off Britain on Friday, Oct 9th at 9.15am</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Speaking after today’s meeting, Mr Pond added: “The Financial Services Commission is encouraged by the growing
      recognition across various sectors that end of life admin processes need to improve. Grieving families must be
      more compassionately treated.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The positive and constructive tone of today's meeting is a good sign that change is coming and we are hopeful
      that it will be a positive step forward for vulnerable customers. I'm fully behind the calls for a cross-industry
      voluntary Bereavement Standard."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bereavement Standard would set a time limit for account closures, standardise paperwork and documents required
      - with an emphasis on digital documents, and would ensure service providers have dedicated bereavement channels
      with properly trained staff, available to customers.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Steven Wibberley, CEO of Cruse Bereavement Care</b> said: “Too many bereaved people tell us how badly they are
      treated when contacting businesses to tell them a loved one has died. At worst they face unhelpful bureaucracy,
      unsympathetic staff, repeated requests for the same information.
    </p>
    <p>
      “In the aftermath of a close relative’s death, people should be able to spend time with their families to grieve.
      They should not need to devote hours going back and forth with companies on matters that should be
      straightforward. This is why we are supporting the Bereavement Standard, to improve and simplify this process, and
      also why we provide expert training to companies.”
