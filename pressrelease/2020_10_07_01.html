    <h1>Finance chiefs to attend ‘Bereavement Standard’ summit</h1>
    <h2>
      Financial and insurance sectors urged to improve end of life admin for customers
    </h2>
    <p class="date">Oct 07, 2020</p>
    <b>PRESS RELEASE - EMBARGOED 00.01 Wednesday 7th Oct</b>
    <p>
      Senior executives from some of the UK’s biggest banks and insurance companies are due to attend a virtual summit
      today (Wed) to discuss their support for a new ‘Bereavement Standard.’
    </p>
    <p>
      The meeting comes as calls grow for streamlined end-of-life admin processes across all commercial sectors, partly
      due to the rising number of deaths in Britain this year caused by COVID-19.
    </p>
    <p>
      Financial organisations are under pressure from various quarters - including regulators and the Financial Conduct
      Authority - to improve their treatment of vulnerable customers and end of life administration fits directly into
      this important mandate.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Chris Pond, Chair of the Financial Inclusion Commission</b>, who is chairing part of the summit, said: “While
      the global pandemic has affected every British family, and brought great sadness to many families, it is good to
      see the financial services industry coming together to make things better for both bereaved and vulnerable
      customers.
    </p>
    <p>
      “COVID-19 is shining a light on some of the broken bereavement processes and I'm excited by the opportunity to
      pilot a new way of simplifying end-of-life account closure.”
    </p>
    <p>
      More than 60 organisations, including high street banks, insurance companies and intermediary firms, are due to be
      represented at the summit, which is being jointly hosted by online startup
      <a href="https://settld.care/">Settld</a>, and Cruse Bereavement Care.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bereavement Standard would set a time limit for account closures, standardise paperwork and documents
      required, and would ensure service providers have dedicated bereavement channels with properly trained staff,
      available to customers.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Given the Competition and Market Authority's recent critical report of the Funeral Sector, it is good that new
      startups like Settld are coming into the space to shake things up and improve customer experience. I'm fully
      behind their call for a cross-industry voluntary Bereavement Standard,” added Chris Pond.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nearly 90,000 people have signed an online petition calling on the government to introduce a Bereavement Standard,
      and 50 MPs have signed a similar cross-party Early Day Motion in the Commons. The campaign is being featured on
      <b>BBC1’s Rip Off Britain on Friday, Oct 9th</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Vicky Wilson, co-founder of Settld</b> - which is launching an online app to automate end of life account
      closure processes which will be free to the public - said: “It is crucial that the biggest banks and insurers
      support a Bereavement Standard if we are to see improved services for the most vulnerable in society. It’s hugely
      encouraging to see the main players in the sector attending this summit and we hope it’s a sign of positive
      changes to come.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Across the UK, more than 600,000 people die every year. Currently, there is no approved process for closing
      accounts when someone dies. On average individuals have up to 20 utility, banking, mobile, broadband, TV
      subscription, and other household service accounts which need to be closed.
