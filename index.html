        <h2>Launching soon!</h2>
        <p>
          When someone dies there are numerous accounts (utilities, banking,
          phone, broadband, insurance, TV, subscription services etc.) which
          need to be closed. Settld was born out of our team's personal
          experience of loss, and the frustration at having to spend hours
          contacting each company, then waiting weeks, to complete this task.
          Launching in July 2020, our goal is simple: cut the bereavement red
          tape and remove the stress for others, free of charge. <br />
          Support our <b>#BereavementStandard</b> campaign to help us take the
          complexity out of end of life admin.
