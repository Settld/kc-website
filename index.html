        <h1>End of <span id="life">life</span> admin made simple.</h1>
        <h2>Launching soon.</h2>
        <p>
          When someone dies they leave behind a number of accounts which need to
          be closed &mdash; utilities, banking, boardband, insurance, the list
          goes on. Settld was born out of our team's personal experience of
          loss, and our frustration at spending hours contacting each company
          and waiting weeks for confirmation of acount closure. Launching in
          July 2020, Settld has one simple goal: cut the bereavment red tape and
          remove the stress for others, free of charge.
